<h3>Neat Thing: Criterion Collection</h3>
<h5>All right let me tell you about a thing...</h5>

<p>Strictly speaking the they define themselves as I suppose a collective (although officially a company) that started in 1984 focusing on the film aficionado clientele. As tends to happen with anything that, frankly, you don’t see 5 commercials for in one day it’s bounced around a bit by owners, shareholders, partnerships, and distributers (&lt;-- the current of which is Sony). The idea being that they celebrate and provide a series of "important classic and contemporary films", cherry picked on a global scale and providing a format and edition that offers the best and truest viewing experience for preserving a library. </p>

<p>In a way they've actually helped standardize certain aspects of home market distribution. Special features such as featurettes, commentary, special editions, alternate takes, and wide screen viewing options, which are almost standard now for any physical format purchase, was pioneered by Criterion as offering supplements to enrich the viewing experience. And everyone has partaken at some point; whether just for outtakes or for something that truly spoke to you from a film.</p>

<p class="moviepic"> <img src = "images\semi-flip.jpg" alt = "Like how The Dark Knight achieved the stunt of flipping a 18 wheeler semi-trailer truck by flipping a motherflipp’n 18 wheeler semi-trailer truck"> </p>

<p>They also help congregate licensing and distribution services to be able to allocate to the public, because of this they’re a pretty solid go-to to go to to find something to watch. Now I’m still getting a handle on the hows and whys certain films are added (although I suspect a lot has to do with licensing rights, you’ll find some of the weirdest business happens because of licensing rights – see Spider-Man, Spider-Man reboot, and soon to come Spider-Man Reboot: Son of Reboot) </p>

<p>So while you’ll run into some fancy names that impress the fancy movie people, like: Kurosawa, Fellini, Hitchcock, Kubrick; you’ll also miss out on others such as Georges M&eacuteli&egraves (did really, really, early work with a focus on the fantastical- A Trip to the Moon, 1902), Steven Spielberg (c'mon, honestly?), or George Lucas (let’s be honest, we can figure out why for George Lucas). Which is a huge shame because Méliès is flat out known for having most of his work lost to time or simply destroyed. There is an entire generation who’s gone into archeology and paleontology thanks to 1993 and Jurassic Park therein. And frankly speaking? Every single Star Wars fan I have ever ran into has at least one bone to pick that Lucas changed or updated since the untouched VHS release of the original trilogy (granting that they did infact see a VHS untouched release of the original trilogy), thus making VHS copies more coveted than blu ray special edition packs. </p>

<p>And not to go on any kind of social justice rant but unless I’ve simply not recognized any feminine names (possible since the collection is supposed to be a global representation) there’s a definite tip of the scales on gender representation. </p>

<p>Additionally, let’s be frank (or Francine) (I’m sorry) the company is American founded, based, and supplies to an American audience so I can’t help but wonder what the collection may be inadvertently missing from the foreign film market by simple virtue of it being a foreign film. While there are many values and experiences that is shared by human nature there are also distinct culturally coded values that those unfamiliar with would be unable to properly grasp such as <div class="foreign">"machismo"</div> (strong pride in masculine associated values: origin Mexican-Spanish), <div class="foreign">"giri"</div> and <div class="foreign">"ninj&omacr;"</div> ("burden of obligation" and "human feeling" respectively: origin Japanese), and the joint family system (family units usually involving at least 2 generations in the same residence: practiced in many non-western societies) to name a few. This would be a prime example of when extra features could supplement the full experience to appreciate a film. </p>

<p>Especially with the current trend of streaming becoming the preferred access to movie collections, and the possibility of greater access to collections, the original intent of providing a full experience of cinema has never been so available and yet by the same reasoning has also never been so restrictive in it’s presentations. </p>

<p id="conclusion">In conclusion: Love the idea, could be better. </p>
